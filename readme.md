fun with websockets.

## Startup

`rackup`, or `ruby app.rb`, or run the Procfile or whatever

## What does it

any realistic URL will open up a chatroom on that port via the magic of
websockets.   Limited to whatever the theoretical limit of available
ports is (something like 65k..?).

e.g. `localhost:3000/4040` for chatting with others on port 4040

## Misc

totally not production ready or secure or scaleable or any of that jazz.
